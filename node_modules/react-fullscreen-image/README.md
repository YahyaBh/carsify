You've got a list of images that you want to allow users to click and expand into fullscreen mode.

React Fullscreen Image is a tiny library to render images that animate to fullscreen view when
clicked.

## Features

- Only animates transform and opacity properties.
- Keyboard event handlers (escape key, left/right arrow navigation).
- Handles outer click â€” anywhere outside of image when clicked will zoom image to its original
  position.
- Scrolling (with requestAnimationFrame) to a set boundary will zoom image to its original position.

## Usage

React Fullscreen Image uses [compound components](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks). All `<Image />` components nested within an `<ImageGroup />` will be navigatable when in fullscreen mode.

```jsx
import { ImageGroup, Image } from 'react-fullscreen-image'

const images = [

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ImageGroup>
      <ul className="images">
        {images.map(i => (
          <li key={i}>
            <Image
              src={i}
              alt="nature"
              style={{
                position: 'absolute',
                top: 0,
                left: 0,
                right: 0,
                bottom: 0,
                height: '100%',
                width: '100%',
                objectFit: 'cover',
              }}
            />
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </ImageGroup>
