has a mid-mounted 828-horsepower V12</h1>\r\n                            <h4>Its design takes inspiration from race cars new and old</h4>\r\n                            <br />\r\n                            <p>t turns out the rumors were true, and Ferrari has just revealed its latest in its special \"Icona\" line of supercars. It's called the Ferrari Daytona SP3, and it takes its name from the 1967 24 Hours of Daytona in which three of the brand's race cars finished 1-2-3. And it takes its basic design and layout from similarly vintage mid-engine race cars.\r\n                                That mid-mounted engine is a version of the 812 Superfast's 6.5-liter V12. It still has a 9,500-rpm redline, but it makes slightly more power at 828 ponies. That means it now holds the title of most powerful naturally aspirated, non-hybrid, road-going Ferrari in history. It also makes 514 pound-feet of torque and is paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. Ferrari says it will get to 62 mph in 2.85 seconds and to 124 in 7.4 seconds.\r\n                                Surrounding the engine is a body .</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\r\n                            <img src=\"/Images/Blogs/Fra.jpg\" alt=\"ferrari\" width=\"100%\" />\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"row text-center mt-3\">\r\n                        <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\r\n                            <h1>Apple reportedly aims to debut a fully self-driving car in 2025</h1>\r\n                            <h4>Apple is chasing a holy grail within the industry</h4>\r\n                            <br />\r\n                            <p>Apple Inc. is pushing to accelerate development of its electric car and is refocusing the project around full self-driving capabilities, according to people familiar with the matter, aiming to solve a technical challenge that has bedeviled the auto industry.\r\n                                For the past several years, Apple’s car team had explored two simultaneous paths: creating a model with limited self-driving capabilities focused on steering and acceleration — similar to most current cars from Tesla Inc. —or a version with full self-driving ability that doesn’t require human intervention.\r\n                                Under the effort’s new leader — Apple Watch software executive Kevin Lynch — engineers are now concentrating on the second option. Lynch is pushing for a car with a full self-driving system in the first version, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private.</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\r\n                            <img src=\"/Images/Blogs/Apple.jpg\" alt=\"apple\" width=\"100%\" />\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"row text-center mt-3\">\r\n                        <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\r\n                            <h1>Too late for Biden's help on Thanksgiving gas prices</h1>\r\n                            <h4>Though his oil price approach is working despite inaction</h4>\r\n                            <br />\r\n                            <p>President Joe Biden is working hard to do something about the sky-high gasoline prices facing Americans. But it’s already too late to lower costs for travel over Thanksgiving.\r\n                                All eyes in the oil market have been on Biden to see whether his administration will announce a release from the national Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a bid to keep energy costs under control. But even if those extra crude barrels hit the market today and sent futures down, it would likely be another seven to 10 days before that would fully show up at the pump for consumers, said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.\r\n                                That means travelers will be stuck with high prices, just as driving for the holiday is expected to reach close to pre-pandemic levels.</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\r\n                            <img src=\"/Images/Blogs/shell.jpg\" alt=\"apple\" width=\"100%\" />\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"row text-center mt-3\">\r\n                        <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\r\n                            <h1>Tesla worker alleges 'rampant sexual harassment' in lawsuit</h1>\r\n                            <h4>Female employee describes a production line that's like 'a frat house'</h4>\r\n                            <br />\r\n                            <p>Female employees at Tesla’s Fremont factory in California face “rampant sexual harassment,” according to a lawsuit filed on Thursday. In a complaint with the state’s Superior Court in Alameda County, Jessica Barraza, 38, a production associate with Tesla, said she was subjected to “nightmarish” working conditions over the past three years. Barraza’s lawsuit describes a factory floor that looks more like “a crude, archaic construction site or frat house” than the site of advanced EV production.\r\n                                Barraza’s allegations against Tesla are numerous. In one incident, the suit alleges a male co-worker stuck his leg between her thighs when she went to punch in after a lunch break. Amid the harassment, Barraza says her complaints fell on deaf ears. In one instance, she says a supervisor did nothing when she complained of a co-worker staring at her breasts. “Maybe you shouldn’t wear shirts that draw attention to your chest,.</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\r\n                            <img src=\"/Images/Blogs/Fac.jpg\" alt=\"apple\" width=\"100%\" />\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"row text-center mt-3\">\r\n                        <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\r\n                            <h1>MV Agusta Rapido Serie Oro is an e-scooter with a Sport+ mode</h1>\r\n                            <h4>Its design is almost motorcycle-like</h4>\r\n                            <br />\r\n                            <p>MV Agusta, the purveyor of some of Italy's most powerful and track-capable motorcycles, is stepping into the e-scooter segment.
