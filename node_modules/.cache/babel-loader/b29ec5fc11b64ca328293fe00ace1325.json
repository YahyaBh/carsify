DriveView\\u2122 If you are eligible for and opt-in to DriveView (a usage-based insurance program), VW will collect and use commercial and electronic network activity information collected through Car-Net Services about your driving behavior, such as speed, braking and seat belt usage, and GPS location in order to assess your driving and routinely provide you a DriveView score (i.e. a score based on certain factors that are considered higher indicators of risk collision, such as hard braking, nighttime driving, idle time and high speed). We will collect this data directly from you and your use of the Car-Net technologies. We also will use aggregated data to conduct driver behavior modeling (for example, comparing drivers across different states). If you opt-in and direct us to do so, we also will send your driver behavior and GPS location data to our insurance company partners for consideration. They may offer discounts depending on your driving record. You can also opt-in to DriveView and direct us to share your driving data and GPS location data with your existing insurance carrier. We will provide it only at your direction, but you may discontinue sharing at any time by un-enrolling in DriveView. Please visit the Car-Net website for more information about the DriveView program, eligibility requirements and how you can participate. 15.

How Do We Use Your Information?\r\n                We collect and use your information for a number of business purposes, such as:\r\n\r\n                To provide you with products and services, such as to provide products and services you request; support your vehicle, products and services; diagnose, repair and track service and quality issues; communicate with you about your vehicle, products or services; install and configure changes and updates to your services; authenticate users of our products and services; verify your eligibility for certain programs or benefits; or to provide you with Car-Net Services.\r\n                For our own internal business purposes, such as to evaluate the usage, performance and safety of our vehicles, products and services; improve the quality of our vehicles, products and services and design new products and services; operate the VW website and digital properties and customize the content; and maintain internal records.\r\n                For legal, safety or security reasons, such as to comply with legal requirements; protect the safety, property or rights of VW and the Volkswagen Group family of companies, including VCI (and its right to repossess its vehicles, including through the use of GPS data); owners, registered users, drivers, passengers or others; or prevent and detect fraud or misuse of the vehicles, products or services.\r\n                For marketing, however, please note that precise GPS location data or your driver behavior data will not be used for VW marketing purposes or shared with unaffiliated third parties to use for their own marketing purposes without your affirmative consent.\r\n                In a de-identified or aggregated format, we may also use or share your information in a de-identified or aggregate manner for any purpose.\r\n                For services of third parties that you authorize, with your consent, we will provide the information needed by third parties that we introduce or with whom you independently engage in order to provide their services to you.\r\n                We also provide your information to third parties who use it for the commercial purpose of marketing their products and services to you. Please note that for MY19 and older vehicles, GPS location will only be used for purposes of providing Car-Net Services to subscribers or to comply with legal process or as otherwise required by law.\r\n\r\n                If you choose to create a Volkswagen ID you may be able to use it to sign into other Volkswagen websites, applications or services. Instead of registering with each service, you can access multiple Volkswagen services using your Volkswagen ID. If you do this, the services will be linked to your central Volkswagen ID user account. If you access a Volkswagen service using your Volkswagen ID, the information already stored in association with your central Volkswagen ID user account (including personal information) will be linked and used in accordance with the Privacy Statement and Terms of Service for that particular service. If you prefer not to have this information shared between services, you have the option of creating a separate Volkswagen ID user account to sign into each Volkswagen service that you use.\r\n                4. With Whom Do We Share Your Information?\r\n                We may share your information:\r\n\r\n                Within the Volkswagen Group family of companies, which includes parents, corporate affiliates, subsidiaries, business units and other companies that share common ownership, including Volkswagen AG, which is located outside of the United States, and VCI.\r\n                With third-party service providers working on behalf of VW, such as advertising agencies and other third parties that assist us with marketing efforts, emergency responders, IT and call center service providers.\r\n                With VW Dealers for sales, leasing, and customer service purposes, such as responding to quote requests, vehicle diagnosis, maintenance and repair, scheduling service appointments, and contacting you and providing the requested services.\r\n                With others for legal, security or safety purposes, we may share your information with third parties, law enforcement or other government agencies to comply with law or legal requirements; to enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements, or those of the Volkswagen Group family of companies; and to protect our rights and the property or safety of our users or third parties. We also may disclose information about you and your vehicle when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of the websites or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.\r\n                With other companies in connection with a VW corporate transaction, if we or some or all of our assets are acquired by another company, including through a sale in connection with bankruptcy, we will share the information that we hold with that company.\r\n                With third parties for their own marketing purposes, we share your contact information and vehicle identification data with third parties for their own marketing purposes such as Sirius XM, VW Dealers, Verizon and select companies with whom we may partner to offer you products or services.\r\n                Integrated Content Providers.

Online Advertising\r\n                To provide you with a more relevant and interesting experience, VW may work with third party companies to display ads or customize the content of the VW digital properties. These companies may use cookies (a small text file), pixels, tags, or similar technologies that are placed in browsers to gather information about your visits to a VW digital property, as well as your visits elsewhere on the Internet over time. These companies use this information to provide you with more relevant advertising known as interest-based advertising. Some of these companies participate with the Digital Advertising Alliance (\"DAA\"). The DAA offers a choice mechanism with respect to certain types of data collection and use. We adhere to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Visit www.aboutads.info to exercise choice with respect to DAA participants or click on the AboutAds icon on a VW advertisement and follow the instructions on how to opt out. If you change computers, devices, or browsers; use multiple computers, devices, or browsers; or delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer, device, or browser. Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from VW or its agents or representatives.\r\n\r\n                7. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies\r\n                The VW websites also collect information, via cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags or other tracking technologies, such as your Internet Service Provider and IP address, the date and time you access the VW website, the pages you have accessed while visiting the VW website, and the Internet address from which you accessed the VW website. Some cookies exist only during a single session and some are persistent over multiple sessions over time. We use these technologies to remember user preferences, maximize the performance of our website and services, provide you with offers that may be of interest to you, measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns and to personalize online content.\r\n\r\n                You may refuse or delete cookies. If you refuse or delete cookies, some of our website functionality may be impaired. If you previously accepted cookies and directed us to share your information on one of our sites, you can change your cookie preference by clicking on the cookie settings link in the footer of that site.

If you set your browser to signal that you do not wish to be tracked online, we will honor your preference by disabling social media and targeted advertising cookies.\r\n\r\n                8. Mobile Applications Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies\r\n                In addition to mobile applications designed to allow you to use your Car-Net® Services, VW may have mobile applications that you can download to your mobile device or vehicle (“VW Applications”). When you download a VW Application, there may be an opportunity for you to provide us with or for us to obtain information about you or your vehicle. Each VW Application will display a Privacy Statement that will inform you about how any new or different information shared via the application will be handled. Otherwise, information collected via VW Applications will be the information identified above and will be used and shared as stated in this Privacy Statement.\r\n\r\n                Through the Infotainment system, VW may also offer applications developed by third parties, for example Apple CarPlay or Android Auto (“3rd Party Application”). When you download a 3rd Party Application to your mobile device or vehicle, the 3rd Party Application may collect information about you or your vehicle in connection with your download or use of that application. VW is not responsible for the collection or use of information by 3rd Party Applications. We recommend that you carefully review the privacy statement and terms of use of each 3rd Party Application prior to downloading or using them.\r\n\r\n                9. Our Commitment to Children's Privacy\r\n                VW does not knowingly collect, use, share or sell the information of children under the age of 16.

Some of these sites may share a similar “look and feel” to the VW websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements provided by other websites before you provide information to them.\r\n\r\n                11. Security\r\n                VW maintains reasonable safeguards to protect your information. Some services, including Car-Net® Services, may involve the transmission of voice and data from your VW vehicle over wireless and cellular telephone networks and therefore, we cannot guarantee the privacy and security of conversations or data transmitted to and from your VW vehicle.\r\n\r\n                12.

DriveView™\r\n                If you are eligible for and opt-in to DriveView (a usage-based insurance program), VW will collect and use commercial and electronic network activity information collected through Car-Net Services about your driving behavior, such as speed, braking and seat belt usage, and GPS location in order to assess your driving and routinely provide you a DriveView score (i.e. a score based on certain factors that are considered higher indicators of risk collision, such as hard braking, nighttime driving, idle time and high speed). We will collect this data directly from you and your use of the Car-Net technologies. We also will use aggregated data to conduct driver behavior modeling (for example, comparing drivers across different states). If you opt-in and direct us to do so, we also will send your driver behavior and GPS location data to our insurance company partners for consideration. They may offer discounts depending on your driving record. You can also opt-in to DriveView and direct us to share your driving data and GPS location data with your existing insurance carrier. We will provide it only at your direction, but you may discontinue sharing at any time by un-enrolling in DriveView.\r\n\r\n                Please visit the Car-Net website for more information about the DriveView program, eligibility requirements and how you can participate.\r\n\r\n                15.
